# AI Course Directory Source Code

**Type:** Web App · **Tech Stack:** React, Vite, TypeScript · **Year:** 2025

### **Overview**

The **AI Course Directory** is a web application I developed to showcase activities and learning materials for students enrolled in my AI course. It provides a centralised and secure platform where students can explore projects, lessons, and interactive demonstrations related to artificial intelligence.

You will be able to access the actual site [here](https://moaesaycto.github.io/ai-games).

### **Purpose**

This project serves both as a teaching tool and an example of my front-end development workflow. It demonstrates how a simple, efficient interface can support structured learning in emerging technologies.

### **Source Code**

The [source code](#) is available for transparency and educational purposes, allowing others to explore the site’s architecture or verify the privacy policy.
Course access codes are stored securely via environment variables and are **not** included in the repository. They may be available in the future (after the course is finished) or upon request in some cases.

### **Note**

Please do not reuse or modify this code unless you or your child is an active participant in the course.
